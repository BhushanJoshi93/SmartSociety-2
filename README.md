# SmartSociety
The objective of the “Smart Society” is to provide a system which handles the information of the residents of a commercial housing society. 

## Problem Specification:
Today’s societies are working manually. The current system is costly and time
consuming as it involves a lot of manual paper work which is tedious and tiring.
As we have computerization and automation it is possible to make a system for solving
the mentioned problems.
The following are the reasons why the current system should be computerized:
• Recording details of each and every member and staff consumes time.
• It is very difficult to maintain the visitor log information.
• The records are manually maintained which consumes time and energy.
• Lot of paper work is involved as the records are maintained in the registers
• Less efficiency and costly.
• As files and registers are used the they are vulnerable to environmental
calamities as they can wear and tear.
• Also files and registers uses lot of space.
• Use of papers for storing valuable data information is not at all reliable.
• Manual systems mean increased human error.
• Manual collection of society maintenance payments is tiring job for the
secretary.

## Merits of Proposed System:

The system is very simple in design and to implement. The system requires Very
low system resources and the system will work in almost all Configurations.
Merits are:
• Security of data and residents/members
• Ensure data accuracy
• Administrator and secretary controls the entire system
• Portable
• E-notice generation.
• Online payments
• Error prone
• Proper event management of assets of society
• Proper Visitor log generation for increased security
• Direct Connection with the security guards for increased security
• Minimize manual data entry
